The Specific Type Ia Supernova Rate: A Tale of Star Formation Histories,
Binary Fractions, and Metallicity

1. 2 panel figure

	left: Specific Ia rate as a function of \tau_sfh, the e-folding timescale
	of the SFH, taken from an order of magnitude calculation assuming an
	exponential SN Ia DTD and an exponential SFH.

		Main point of the story is that the specific Ia rate increases when
		the star formation history is extended. The DTD is extended, but not
		so extended that SNe will occur in significant amounts even after star
		formation stops. With the specific Ia rate known to increase at low
		stellar masses, this is an effect of the right sign.

	right: SFHs at a few representative masses taken from the universe machine
	catalog.

		Main point here is to demonstrate more quantitatively that low mass
		field galaxies have more extended SFHs.

2. 3 panel figure

	left: Analytic curves for specific Ia rate as a function of stellar mass
		given the universe machine SFHs and the Andrews & Martini (2013)
		mass-metallicity relation assuming different indeces for the power-law
		Z-dependence

		Main point is that if the scaling goes as ~M^-0.3 as Gandhi et al.
		(2022) suggests, then this can be explained by a ~Z^-0.5 scaling.

	middle: A sampled version of the left panel.

		Main point is that even though we don't get power-laws in our analytic
		forms, they would look like power-laws if sampled by an ASAS-SN-like
		survey.

	right: Power-law index of Z-dependence on the y-axis and power-law index
	of mass-dependence on the x-axis, showing how much power in Z you need for a
	given scaling in mass if you believe the universe machine SFHs and the
	Andrews & Martini (2013) mass-metallicity relation.

		Main point is just to show the relationship between the massdependence
		and the metallicity dependence required to produce that in a little
		more detail.


3. Binary fraction as a function of Z taken from Moe, Kratter & Badenes (2019)
	with various scalings of Z overlapped, and a vertical line at
	log10(Z/Zsun) = -1.08 (the metallicity of the lowest mass galaxies
	probed by our study).

	Main point is that a Z^-0.5 scaling generally lines up with their
	measurements, but is a *tad* higher at the lowest masses and metallicities
	that we consider. This suggests that the majority of the specific Ia rate
	effect can be explained with the increased binary fraction at low Z, but
	that at the lowest masses and metallicities, there may be an additional
	effect if the specific Ia rate continues to increase.
