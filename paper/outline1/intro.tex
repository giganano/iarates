\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

\begin{itemize}

	\item Supernova surveys have revealed that low mass galaxies are
	more efficient producers of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) than their higher
	mass counterparts~\citep[e.g.][]{Mannucci2005}.
	Using archival spectroscopic data,~\citet{Brown2019} derived stellar
	masses for the host galaxies of SNe Ia observed by the All Sky
	Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN), finding that the specific SN
	Ia rate -- the rate per unit stellar mass -- scales approximately with
	the inverse square root of the mass itself (i.e.
	$\dot{N}_\text{Ia} / M_\star \sim M_\star^{-0.5}$).
	\citet{Gandhi2022} demonstrate that this dependence is unfortunately
	plagued by uncertainties in the galaxy stellar mass function (SMF).
	While~\citet{Brown2019} used the~\citet{Bell2003} SMF, the scaling becomes
	shallower (approximately~$\dot{N}_\text{Ia} / M_\star \sim M_\star^{-0.3}$)
	when using the steeper form from~\citet{Baldry2012} due to a more abundant
	underlying galaxy population at low stellar masses.
	This leads to significantly better agreement between the ASAS-SN
	measurements and Wiseman et al.'s~\citeyearpar{Wiseman2021} rates measured
	with SNe Ia from the Dark Energy Survey (DES), also normalized with the
	\citet{Baldry2012} SMF.
	Although there is debate surrounding the strength of the scaling, the
	qualitative result that the specific SN Ia rate is higher in dwarf galaxies
	is now well-established.
	The origin of this effect is a topic that has received noteworthy attention
	in the literature recently, and there are a handful of potential pathways.

	\item First, the mean star formation histories (SFHs) of galaxies are known
	to vary as a function of stellar mass.
	Semi-analytic models (SAMs) of galaxy formation (see, e.g., the
	reviews of~\citealp{Baugh2006} and~\citealp*{Somerville2015a}) suggest that
	dwarf galaxies in the field have more extended SFHs than their higher mass
	counterparts.
	Unless the SN Ia delay-time distribution~\citep[DTD; e.g.][]{Maoz2012a}
	depends on a galaxy's stellar mass in a highly specific manner, this should
	impact the intrinsic SN Ia rate across the various galaxy demographics.

	\item Second,~\citet{Kistler2013} argue that the inverse dependence of the
	specific SN Ia rate on stellar mass can be explained by considering
	metallicity as a confounding variable.
	Lower mass galaxies are empirically known to host lower metallicity stellar
	populations~\citep{Gallazzi2005, Kirby2013} as a consequence of lower
	metallicity gas reservoirs (\citealp{Tremonti2004, Andrews2013};
	\citealp*{Zahid2011};~\citealp{Zahid2014}).
	Whether or not a WD explodes as a SN Ia should be sufficiently decoupled
	from its galactic environment, making the chemical composition of the
	progenitor populations a more attractive explanation.
	\citet{Kistler2013} postulate that this could arise because at fixed
	initial mass, lower metallicity stars leave behind higher mass WDs, which
	could allow them to grow to the Chandrasekhar mass and explode more easily.
	This arises due to the low Rosseland mean opacity of a low metallicity
	plasma which gives rise to weaker winds from asymptotic giant branch stars,
	leading to lower mass loss rates and stronger core growth, produing a
	higher mass remnant at fixed initial mass (\citealp{Umeda1999, Willson2000,
	Marigo2007};~\citealp*{Meng2008};~\citealp{Zhao2012, Kalirai2014}).

	\item Furthermore, whether they arise from the single-
	\citep[e.g.][]{Whelan1973} or double-degenerate channel
	\citep[e.g.][]{Iben1984, Webbink1984}, SNe Ia are believed to arise from
	binary star systems.
	Based on multiplicity measurements of solar-type stars in APOGEE\footnote{
		Apache Point Observatory Galaxy Evolution Experiment
	}~\citep{Majewski2017}, the close binary fraction is known to increase
	with decreasing metallicity (\citealp{Badenes2018};~\citealp*{Moe2019}).
	Motivated by these results,~\citet{Gandhi2022} explore a handful of
	parametrizations for the metallicity-dependence of the SN Ia rate in
	re-simulated galaxies from FIRE-2~\citep{Hopkins2018} and find that a
	$Z^{-0.5}$ scaling leads to better agreement with the observed stellar
	mass - stellar metallicity relation than with metallicity-independent
	rates.
	They disfavor models with a stronger metallicity-dependence (e.g.
	$\sim Z^{-1}$) because the predictions of such models are in tension
	with the relationship between the [Mg/Fe] and [Fe/H] abundances in M31
	satellite galaxies observed by~\citet*{Vargas2014}.

	\item At first glance, an inverse dependence of SN Ia rates on metallicity
	may seem at odds with the recent realization by~\citet{Holoien2022} that
	dwarf galaxy hosts of SNe Ia detected by ASAS-SN tend to be oxygen-rich
	relative to similar mass galaxies.
	However, the hosts of SNe Ia detected by surveys like ASAS-SN are likely
	not a representative sample of the underlying galaxy population at any
	stellar mass because, due to the steeply declining nature of the DTD
	\citep[e.g.][]{Maoz2012}, the intrinsically highest SN Ia rates should
	be in systems which experienced a recent starburst ($\lesssim$1 Gyr ago).
	Since oxygen is an alpha element produced by massive stars with lifetimes
	significantly shorter than the delay times of SNe Ia
	\citep*[e.g.][]{Hurley2000, Johnson2019}, these galaxies should also have
	a higher-than-average oxygen abundance (for theoretical discussion of
	starbursts in galactic chemical evolution models, see,
	e.g.,~\citealt{Johnson2020}).

	\item In the present paper, we assume that a metallicity-dependence is the
	reason for the strong scaling of the SN Ia rate with stellar mass and
	conduct simple numerical calculations to investigate potential origins of
	the effect.
	We combine the relationship between galaxy stellar mass and mean SFH
	predicted by the~\textsc{UniverseMachine} SAM for galaxy
	formation~\citep{Behroozi2019} with the popular~$\tau^{-1}$ delay-time
	distribution (DTD) for SNe Ia~\citep[e.g.][]{Maoz2012a} and empirical
	parametrizations of the mass-metallicity relation for galaxies
	\citep{Andrews2013, Zahid2014}.
	With a given SFH and DTD, we can compute the SN Ia rate for a galaxy of
	some stellar mass, and by assuming that it lies on the observed
	mass-metallicity relation, we can simultaneously fold in various
	assumptions about how the overall rate might scale with metallicity~$Z$.
